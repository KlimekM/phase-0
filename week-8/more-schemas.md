The image above is an example of a one-to-one schema, because each football team can have only one starting quarterback. Each starting quarterback is the starter for only one team and each team has only one starting quarterback so they have an individual or one-to-one relationship.

Reflection:

**What is a one-to-one database?**

A one-to-one database is a database that contains two different tables that have a single relationship between them.

**When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).**

We would use a one-to-one database or relationship when an item is unique to a given table and that item has a unique and individual relationship with another item that is unique to a seperate table. They can both only be present once in each of their given tables and have some sort of individual relationship between them.

**What is a many-to-many database?**

A many-to-many database or relationship is when a group has a relationship with another group in numerous ways. For instance if we had a table of musicians and songs we would join the two tables in a new table that would list the musician id and the song id. This would be a many-to-many relationship, because numerous musicians can collaborate on a given song and each musician can have numerous songs with different song ids.

**When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).**

We would use many-to-many databases when a particular person has multiple projects and certain collaborators on their projects. 

**What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense?**

One to one relationships make a lot of sense to me, but I am still slightly confused by many-to-many relationships. I get why and how they work, but I have to stop myself and think about what is happening in the joined table or how each of the ids can have a many-to-many relationship.
