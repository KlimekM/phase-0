**Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.**

**Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.**

To create a repository on GitHub you must first navigate to github.com and sign in with your username. Once signed in, in the top right corner you will click the + sign and select "New repository". You will then input what you want to name your repository, select whether you want to make it public or private, and add any licenses that you may want. After all of the selections you will click the green "Create repository" button to create the repository. Once the repository is created you will see your [Username]/[repositoryname] which will tell you if you are in the correct repository. On the right side of the screen there will be a URL which you will copy. You will then access your command terminal, type "git clone [Insert copied URL here]", and press enter to successfully clone the repository to your local computer.

**Describe what open source means.**

Open source means that your product or code is free and open for anyone to copy, make changes to, and work on.

**What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?**

My feelings on Open Source jump from one end of the spectrum to the other. On one hand I feel nervous that my code is out there for any and everyone to see and change, but on the other I feel comforted knowing that I can ask for help if necessary and the person can see exactly what I was working on without any loops to jump through.

**Assess the importance of using licenses.**

Licenses are definitely important, because you want to be credited for your work. Even if I am allowing my work to be open source and free for anyone to share, a license will still give some of the credit for the original to the owner of the code. It obviously all depends on the type of license that is instituted, but there is a lot of value in the license and being able to set the boundaries that you deem important.

**What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?**

Learning more about Open Source and how licenses work was definitely crucial in this challenge. Aside from that it was great to get some more experience pushing and pulling files to GitHub. I feel more comfortable pushing my changes to GitHub. I did not have any "aha" moments in this challenge and I still struggle a bit with some of the git commands, but with more experience and reps I will continue to feel more comfortable.


**Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.**

One resource that I found helpful was the official git website. https://git-scm.com/docs lists most of the commands and has each one linked to a more in depth run down of what it does and how to reference it.
