**What is an integer? What is a float?**
An integer is any number without a decimal point. It could be positive, negative, or zero. A float is any number with a decimal point.

**What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?**

The difference between float and integer division is that float division will give you the exact answer to the most accurate decimal point while integer division will round the answer down to the highest integer value. I would explain integer division by saying that if you are dividing a given number and the answer is not a whole number or an integer then that number gets rounded down and the whole number or integer is the answer. For instance if we are dividing 17/2 the answer is 8.5. Since 8.5 is not an integer or a whole number we would round that down to 8 and that would be the answer using integer division.

```
puts 24*365
puts (60*24*365)*8 + (60*24*366)*2
```
