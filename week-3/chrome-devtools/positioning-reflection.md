**How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?**

Chrome DevTools is a great resource to help with formatting and positioning elements. You can access the HTML/CSS code of any website and make changes to the code by right-clicking and selecting the Inspect Element command. In Chrome DevTools you can change the height, width, color, alignment, etc. of a div all within the browser. This allows you to experiment on the code before making the changes on your original file.

**How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?**

There are several ways to resize elements on the DOM using CSS. You can resize them by changing the height/width as a percentage of the screen. You can also resize them by inputting a pixel value or an em value which is a relative unit that is equal to the default font size of whatever screen or device is being used.

**What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?**

An absolute value positions the element in relation to its first positioned ancestor element. The fixed value positions the element in relation to the screen or browser. The static position is the position of the element in the order that it appears in the document. The relative positioning is the elements position in relation to its original location. The easiest for me was definitely fixed positioning. It made sense for me to have something in a set location on one end of the screen. The most difficult is definitely absolute positioning and I am still trying to completely understand how elements with that value work and where they are positioned.

**What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?**

Margin, border, and padding all relate to the content in a given div or element. The padding is the area directly around the content of the element. It falls within the border and can expand the element area. The border is a box or line that goes around the content/padding. Finally, the margin is invisible and it clears an area outside of the border of an element.

**What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)**

Overall I definitely enjoyed this challenge. I thought that it was going to be a bit harder going into it, but it was actually fairly easy to navigate Chrome DevTools. It taught me a lot more about padding, borders, and margins which I struggled with before and helped me get more familiar with the position values and how they function. It was good to experiment with these non-descript boxes and gave me a good base for formatting my own website and content.
