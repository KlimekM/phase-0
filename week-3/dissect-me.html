What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

The HTML5 tags that we used in this challenge were the more common tags such as <p></p>, <a href=""></a>, <ul></ul>, and the <li></li>. We used these tags, because they help differentiate each paragraph, create a hyperlink, and list items in an unordered list. Some of the HTML5 semantic elements that we included were the <header></header>,<main></main>,and the <aside></aside> tags. The reason I continue to returnt to these tags is because they are easily readable and specify were a given element of the page should be.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

Since we are strictly using HTML in this challenge the elements get laid out in the order that we type them in. The content within the <head></head> does not show, but everything in the body shows in the order that it is entered.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

The tab snippet trick was awesome and can be super helpful for saving HTML skeletons in the future. It will be crucial when we lay out an HTML skeleton that we often like to use and can open it by simply typing a word a tabbing. There are tons of snippets out there, but a cool one that I found was one that instantly inserts 3 paragraph tags. Other than snippets I managed to learn that we can open our HTML document in our browser simply by right-clicking in Sublime and selecting open in browser. Prior to this trick I went into my browser and pasted the file so this definitely saves me some time.
