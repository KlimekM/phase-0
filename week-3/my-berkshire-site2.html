<!--
What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?

When linking an external file to an HTML file it is important to make sure that you are using the correct file path. We had some issues initially getting our CSS to run in the HTML document, because our path was off. It is also important to specify the type of file that you are linking to and the rel attribute.

What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it?

It wasn't terribly hard to get the site to look how we wanted. The basic structure was there and the rest was a matter of positioning and styling. The tricks that we used with positioning were aligning the text to the center of the page and setting the margins to auto to center the elements.

What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)

The CSS that we used to modify the element style were: color, font-weight, font-size, text-align, background-color, and border.

Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you choose and why? If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?

We did use one class and one id. The class that we used was to make the horizontal lines since we were unable to use the <hr> tag. We used the class, because there were four lines and the class could work across all four of those lines. The id that we used was to make the "Official Home Page" wording a bigger font size since it was one element that we wanted to change.

When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why?

I believe that our site had the code that followed best practices more accurately. It seems that the Berkshire Hathaway website did a lot of styling in HTML which is frowned upon and harder to read. We did however use a lot of <div> tags in our code which may not have been the cleanest method of approaching the code, but the actual code base also followed that practice.
