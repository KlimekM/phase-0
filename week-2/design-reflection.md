**What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?**

The 6 Phases of Web Design are information gathering, planning, design, development, testing and delivery, and maintenance.

**What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?**

My site's primary goal or purpose is to inform the viewer who I am and introduce them to the projects that I have worked on. The content that I will have on my site will include a brief bio, a link sharing my current work, my blog, and ways that the reader can get in contact with me.

**What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?**

My target audience would be any potential employer. Their interests would include any projects that showcase my coding abilities. I see my site addressing their interests by linking to specific projects and showcasing different things that I have worked on. 

**What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.**

The primary action that the user should take when coming to my site is seeing my portfolio. I want to use the site to promote my work and make my projects attractive and easy for potential employers to locate.

**What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?**

The main thing someone should know about design and user experience is that there is no exact answer or approach that one should take when designing a webpage. Everyone will have different approaches and designs that can appeal to a number of different audiences. The other thing that someone should know is that site traffic does not always mean a positive user experience. The designer should experiment, and poll the users to figure out what works and what does not in order to better their site over time.

**What is user experience design and why is it valuable?**

User experience design is the process of improving your user's experience when accessing and using your site or product. It is valuable, because as a designer you want the user to give you a positive review on your product and continue to use it. If your design is not user friendly and isn't enjoyable for the user when they are interacting with it then they will look for alternative options for the service that is being provided.

**Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?**

The parts of this challenge that I found tedious was the task of getting my website map to properly appear. In addition to that I read all of the optional articles and a couple of extra ones and did not realize just how broad user experience and design can be. There are so many variables for fonts, colors, etc. that I knew existed but not in the quanitities that they are found.
