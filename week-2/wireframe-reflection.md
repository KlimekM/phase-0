**What is a wireframe?**

A wireframe is a template or design of how you want a webpage to look. It is a sketch of the structure for your webpage.

**What are the benefits of wireframing?**

The benefits of wireframing are that you are not going into a project without any idea of how it will turn out. Wireframing provides you with a blueprint that you can use to structure your project or website. Another benefit of wireframing is that it allows you to test out ideas and potential designs for your website without having to commit the changes on the actual site.

**Did you enjoy wireframing your site?**

I did enjoy wireframing my site, but I had a tough time deciding how I wanted the site to look and where I should put a given feature.

**Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?**

I did revise my wireframe once. I kept the original elements, but moved them around so that they were in the order and location that I preferred.

**What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?**

The main question I had during this challenge was whether I needed a footer in the wireframe? I searched google for potential answers and found mixed reviews before deciding not to include one and instead using a side bar for my social media contacts.

**Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?**

I enjoyed setting up a skeleton for my website and visualizing what it might look like, but found it tedious to create boxes for each of the elements in my header. Picking the resource to build the wireframe was another task that I found somewhat tedious.
