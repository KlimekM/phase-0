<!-- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

Translating my previous learning with HTML into an actual site was actually fun. HTML syntax is pretty straight forward and easy to comprehend and working with it to build an actual site was a great experience. It was somewhat rewarding to input the code, refresh the URL, and see the changes that I made appear right before me.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

The resources and syntax that I used did not require me to research a lot of HTML5 elements. Everything seemed to carry over and be compliant with HTML5. The only thing that I did research was an error stating that "An img element must have an alt attribute". From my understanding, I did not need a text alternative of the image, because I wanted the Geico logo to show on my site.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

I tried my best at sticking to best practices when working with HTML. I made sure to indent when necessary to make the code readable and easy to understand. In addition to that I made sure that have the proper closing tags so that no loose end was left untied.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

The good in HTML is that the syntax seems pretty straight forward and easy to understand and read. It seems like making tables can be very tedious and time consuming which I would consider bad.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

One trick that I have for remembering HTML is that the document should be like a human meaning that it should have a head and a body. Another would be that every opening tag has to have a closing tag to finalize the code and make it work on a website.
